- 👋 Hi, I’m @GS-4928, finally dipping my toes in the world of github and crafting a portfolio through markdown and HTML
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and am actively working towards refining my skills in the field
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the principles of an array of machine learning algorithms (KNN, KMeans, Random Forest for regression and classification, PCA etc.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can stretch my knowledge, where I can really contribute whilst I learn
- 📫 How to reach me: a message on here would do nicely!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm in the process of editing my first novel!
